# Simple RAFT implementation (TESTS ARE STILL PENDING)

I just created a simple implementation of the RAFT Protocol.
My main interest is in the leader election process.
Therefore I am mainly focused on that.
You have some shortcuts via the cli.sh file.

## build the container

```bash
bash cli.sh build
```

## start the container

```bash
bash cli.sh start
```

## stop and remove the container

```bash
bash cli.sh stop
```

## check the logs

```bash
bash cli.sh log
```
